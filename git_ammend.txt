(1) if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted to add to this commit, you can do something like this:

*****************git commit --ammend


(2) Unstaging a Staged File

	$ git add *
	$ git status
	On branch master
	Changes to be committed:
  	(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

   	 renamed:    README.md -> README
    	modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md

now suppose you want to unstages the stages file.

	git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md

(3) Unmodifying a Modified File

	git status

	On branch master
	Changes not staged for commit:
 	 (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  	(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   git_ammend.txt

	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


now suppose you wwant to modified file to unmodified file then you can use this command

	git checkout -- git_ammend.txt
